I'm David and I'm a software engineer located in Southern California that focuses on both front- and back-end development. I code mostly in JavaScript-- including many JS frameworks such as React, React Native and Angular, but I am also familiar with Python, Java, and a little bit of C. I'm currently into algorithm scripting, but I enjoy working with data, making great ui/ux, and improving designs and workflows.
